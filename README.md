# Odoo : the Javascript Framework Traning

This branch contains the exercises and the supporting code for the O doo Javascript
Framework Traning. There are four addons, each corresponding to a
standalone project that can be done independently from the others.

To get started, clone this repository, checkout this branch, and start an odoo
server with this folder in the addons path.

Note that a lot of theory is covered in the slides for this event. Also, don't
hesitate to ask questions!
